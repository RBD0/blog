# Definition 1.1

A group is a non-empty set $G$ together with a binary operation on $G$, here denoted by $\star : G\times G \to G$, such that the following three requirements are satisfied :

1. For all $a,b,c\in G$, $(a\star b)\star c = a\star(b\star c)$
2. There exists and element $e\in G$ such that, for every $a\in G$, one has $a\star e = a = e\star a$.
3. For each $a\in G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a\star b = e = b\star a$, where $e$ is the identity element.
