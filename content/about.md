I am Dintyala Rahul Bhardwaj. Dintyala is my family name, Rahul is my name and Bhardwaj is my surname.

I am a fourth year student in a five year B.Tech + M.Tech programme at IIT Delhi studying Mathematics and Computing. I am the overall coordinator of the Mathematics Society of IIT Delhi. I enjoy music, watching documentaries, watching tennis, and sometimes doing math.

The purpose of starting this blog website is to just have an outlet to write things I study. 

My main interest right now is Algebra. I plan on starting a series of blogs on Galois Theory.
